# EduExo-control

-The EduExo Pro is an exoskeleton kit designed to provide support to the elbow and shoulder joints. To assist with the lifting of the shoulder joint, the exoskeleton is equipped with a mechanical spring, while the elbow joint movement is supported by a servo motor. 
-The exoskeleton also features a force sensor in the lower arm, an angle sensor in the elbow joint, and an EMG sensor to measure muscle activity, providing the capability to implement a wider range of control algorithms. 
-The exoskeleton is primarily constructed of metal parts and is connected to the arms via cuffs, and to the upper body through a vest.

-The EduExo Pro kit contains many electrical components such as a Microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 IoT), Servo motor and Angle Sensor, Force Sensor, LED, On/Off Switch, Battery Holder, Buttons, and an EMG Sensor.

-In this project, we aim to create several control methods, to control the exoskeleton. We used the real-time data provided by the EMG sensor measurements to predict the intention of the user and implement an EMG controller.
-Here are some Arduino libraries created that can be useful for further development of the exoskeleton.
